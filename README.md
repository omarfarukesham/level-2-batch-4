# 🌐 Next Level Web Development Journey

Welcome to my "Next Level Web Development" journey! 🚀 Here, I document my learning progress, projects, and concepts mastered in some of the most in-demand technologies in modern web development.

## 🛠️ What I'm Learning

This journey covers a comprehensive set of advanced web development skills, including TypeScript, Next.js, database management, and software architecture principles. Below is an overview of the technologies I’m diving into:

### 📚 Technologies & Concepts

- **TypeScript (TS)**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving me better tooling at any scale.
- **Next.js**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes for scalable applications.
- **Prisma**: A modern ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) that simplifies database management with a schema-driven approach.
- **SQL**: Mastering structured query language for relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and understanding how to efficiently retrieve and manipulate data.
- **NoSQL**: Learning about non-relational databases like MongoDB and Firebase, understanding when and how to use NoSQL solutions.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Building modular, reusable code using principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Web Technologies**: Building expertise in a variety of web technologies, frameworks, and development tools.

### 📈 Learning Goals

This project aims to build a solid foundation in back-end and full-stack web development with TypeScript, improve my knowledge of SQL and NoSQL databases, and implement advanced web development patterns with OOP and modern libraries and frameworks.
